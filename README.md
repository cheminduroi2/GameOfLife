# Conway's Game Of Life

As a little exercise, I decided that I would build each project in (except for the last) the article [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/), using a different language for each project. This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> project in the article, built in Java. To run the [simulation](src/app/App.java), be sure to specify `App.java` as the program's entry point when executing. To run the [test file](src/app/UnitTest.java), be sure to specify `UnitTest.java` as the entry point when running the program.
